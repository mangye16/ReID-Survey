# IJCV 2024: Transformer for Object Re-Identification: A Survey

## Highlights

- An in-depth analysis of Transformer's strengths, highlighting its impact across four key Re-ID directions: image/video-based, limited data/annotations, cross-modal, and special scenarios.

- A new Transformer-based unsupervised baseline, UntransReID, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both single/cross modal Re-ID.

- A unified experimental standard for animal Re-ID, designed to address its unique challenges and evaluate the potential of Transformer-based approaches.
